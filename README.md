It's me! Working on a personal 'spoon-tracking' project.
It doesn't have a \~\*name\~\* yet, but the aim is to build a to-do list / calendar with built-in energy tracking + energy *forecasting*
to help manage energy-levels alongside chronic illness!
It's also aimed at being realistic + kind to the user,
compared to regular to-do lists where the aim always seems to be to do *more and more and more*.
